**README for COMP20**

PURPOSE

The purpose of this GITHUB is that it holds the individual works I have done over the Spring of 2016, and any future works I will do.

FAVORITE ASSIGNMENT

My favorite assignment was assignment 4 because it really showed just how much I had left to learn.

GROWTH

I have grown as a programmer as I can now interpret HTML, Javascript, and can utilize Node and other servers.

IMPORTANT THINGS LEARNED

I learned that the internet is hugely based on client-server interfaces, like how almost everything depends on Get/Post, and that you can never be too secure, such as assignment 4, so you should try and over-engineer your code.

FUTURE

Now that the course is over, I would like to explore more into data-scraping, as our project had a lot of exceptions in getting the recipe ingredients, and while it was frustrating, it was fun.
