<h1>Security Assessment of the Server for Historic Landmarks</h1>

<p>Created by Rihab Fahad</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The assignment was to test Lucas Machamer's Server for Historic Landmarks, as developed by him on assignment 3, for security and privacy problems. According to the specifications from assignment 3, the server was to utilize Heroku, Node.js, Express web framework, and MongoDB in order to create "a web application that maintains location check-ins and served the data of landmarks within a mile of where the [user] is." This report outlines three key security and privacy errors that were found, and how they can be fixed.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>Testing was carried out through a black-box and white-box testing. I was first given only the heroku url, and using my knowledge of the assignment, attempted to attack the site using xss and html-injection, as I knew that there was a post command that likely had not been prepared to protect against such attacks. After getting the source code from Lucas Machamer, I discovered a security error in his code that could be exploited. </p>

<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>

<p>The security issues found are mostly based off the server not checking if the user's input is valid/possibly malicious. There were two instances where the user could input text that acted as code when displayed by the server. As well, there was a particular instance where the site uploaded data to the MongoDB server even though the input data was not complete. This could easily be exploited in many instances in order to upload code that just inherently hides on Mongo to be later called. </p>

<h2>Issues Found</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting</strong>

<ul>
<li>Affects POST API (/sendLocation)</li>
<li>Severity: High: If a script can be added to the database, which is then displayed on the homepage, a malicious user can inject any sort of script and affect all users of the server. While the script I injected was a simple alert, more complex scripts could phish users or break the website itself, for example.</li>

<li>Description: I found this problem by submitting curl data with a script attached to the "login" portion of the query. 
   <p> <img src = "xssscript.jpg" alt = "Curl for submitting script" height = "300" width = "720"title = "XSS submission" /></p>
</li>
<li>Proof: The following is a popup when accessing the website:</code>.
<p> <img src = "attacked.jpg" alt = "After the attack" height = "300" width = "720"title = "After the attack" /></p></li>
<li>Resolution: An easy fix for this problem would be to check all user input for such scripts and on-the-fly convert any "<" or other html indicators to their stringified versions, so any code that is inserted into the database would not be able to be run.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>HTML Injection into POST API</strong>

<ul>
<li>Affects POST API (/sendLocation)</li>
<li>Severity: High: :</li>
<li>Description: 

<p> <img src = "htmlinjection.jpg" alt = "Curl for submitting html" height = "300" width = "720"title = "html submission" /></p></li>
<li>Proof: 

<p> <img src = "bold.jpg" alt = "Affected Page" height = "300" width = "720"title = "Aftermath" /></p></li>
<li>Resolution: As noted above, an easy fix for this problem would be to check all user input for such scripts and on-the-fly convert any "<" or other html indicators to their stringified versions, so any code that is inserted into the database would not be able to be run.

</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Null Addition to Database</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Affects POST API (/sendLocation)</li>
<li>Severity: High: : </li>
<li>Description: 

<p> <img src = "null.jpg" alt = "Curl for submitting no login" height = "300" width = "720"title = "no login" /></p></li>
<li>Proof: 

<p> <img src = "nullpage.jpg" alt = "null in db" height = "300" width = "720"title = "Afterwards" /></p></li>
<li>Resolution

</li>
</ul></li>
