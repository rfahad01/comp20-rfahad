<h1>Security Assessment of the Server for Historic Landmarks</h1>

<p>Created by Rihab Fahad</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The assignment was to test Lucas Machamer's Server for Historic Landmarks, as developed by him on assignment 3, for security and privacy problems. According to the specifications from assignment 3, the server was to utilize Heroku, Node.js, Express web framework, and MongoDB in order to create "a web application that maintains location check-ins and served the data of landmarks within a mile of where the [user] is." This report outlines three key security and privacy errors that were found, and how they can be fixed.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>Testing was carried out through a black-box and white-box testing. I was first given only the heroku url, and using my knowledge of the assignment, attempted to attack the site using xss and html-injection, as I knew that there was a post command that likely had not been prepared to protect against such attacks. After getting the source code from Lucas Machamer, I discovered a security error in his code that could be exploited. </p>

<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>

<p>The security issues found are mostly based off the server not checking if the user's input is valid/possibly malicious. There were two instances where the user could input text that acted as code when displayed by the server. As well, there was a particular instance where the site uploaded data to the MongoDB server even though the input data was not complete. This could easily be exploited in many instances in order to upload code that just inherently hides on Mongo to be later called. </p>
